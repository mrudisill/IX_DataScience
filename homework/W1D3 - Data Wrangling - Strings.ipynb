Let's revist ooour original problem - replacing \"H\" with Hillary when appropriate. We're going to do that by making sure we're only replacing cases where H is the whole string (i.e. the start of the string is before it, and the end of the string is after it). We can do that using the special values '\\A' and '\\Z'."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"v4q8zzHJAOyc"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/var/folders/dk/95f115l12ms7fs6v815_g44c0000gn/T/ipykernel_83405/2187942141.py:2: FutureWarning: The default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.\n","  emails['MetadataTo'].str.replace(r'\\A[H]\\Z', 'Hillary')\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["0            Hillary\n","1            Hillary\n","2                 ;H\n","3            Hillary\n","4       Abedin, Huma\n","            ...     \n","7940         Hillary\n","7941         Hillary\n","7942         Hillary\n","7943         Hillary\n","7944         Hillary\n","Name: MetadataTo, Length: 7945, dtype: object"]},"execution_count":17,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["#To use regex, we simply add an 'r' infront of a string to say we want to match regex, not just the string\n","emails['MetadataTo'].str.replace(r'\\A[H]\\Z', 'Hillary')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JdE6LvRxAOyc"},"source":["Sweet - looks a lot better now!
