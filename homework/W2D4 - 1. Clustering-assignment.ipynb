Clustering online retail customers.\n","\n","For this exercise, we are going to use a small portion of the [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail), that contains information about transactions occurring in November 2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.\n","\n","The assignment is to create a clustering algorithm to group the customers. You should find an optimal number of clusters (a good way is using the elbow method).\n","Finally, you can validate your clustering model using cross validation.\n","\n","This dataset doesn't follow the principles of [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html), because each customerID spans multiple rows with different orders.\n","\n","You will probably need a way to process this dataframe into a dataframe with a customer on each row.\n","\n","There are different ways to process this dataset, for example:\n","\n","- Use a text vectorizer to vectorize the product descriptions then grouping by the customer.\n","- Use `pd.crosstab` to create a dataframe with the customers as rows, the different products as columns and for values how many times each customer bought each product."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"Qk9xRmVpe9mA"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as
