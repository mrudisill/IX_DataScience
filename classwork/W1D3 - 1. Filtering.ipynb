In this notebook, we're going to practice using indices to filter our dataframes.\n","\n","The two most fundamental commands for indexing are `loc` and `iloc` (that is, integer-loc) followed by an identifier for the desired location in square brackets. Mastering the use of `loc` and `iloc` early will set you in good stead for use of the Pandas data API.\n","\n","There are two important things you should know about `iloc`:\n","\n","1. It is reserved for purely number-based indexing (integers only). So if you ever call ```iloc``` with a non-integer index, it will throw an error.\n","2. `iloc` does not interact with your assigned index at all - it only considers the row positions, starting at zero.  This is important to remember if your assigned index is integer-based.\n","\n","In contrast, `loc` references only the assigned index of your dataframe without regard for row ordering.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SFA7ZxidLd6R"},"source":["In this notebook we will cover:\n","\n","1.
